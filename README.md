In this course, my goal is for you to learn how to think about and apply the tools of bacterial molecular genetics to solve scientific problems, and then to use that knowledge to build a strong foundation of understanding the molecular mechanisms by which bacteria grow, function, and cause disease. To achieve this goal, we will need to build your skills in two fundamental areas:

• Scientific literacy: understanding what is and isn’t known, how those facts fit into the larger framework of scientific knowledge, and how to search and read the scientific literature

• Scientific proficiency: understanding how to design, carry out, and interpret experiments, knowing what tools you have available and creatively applying those tools to answer specific questions

The product of scientific work is knowledge. I want to give you the tools to effectively access and add to that knowledge.
By the end of this course, I want you to:
• be able to define the steps of the scientific method and develop models and hypotheses based on data
• know where to find information about bacterial genes and proteins
• be able to use and understand the nomenclature of bacterial genetics
• understand the principles of mutagenesis and genetic engineering in microbes
• know how to interpret mutant phenotypes in different kinds of genes and with different kinds of mutations
• have a good working knowledge of bacterial physiology and cell biology
• be able to design rigorous experiments to solve biological problems using bacterial genetics
